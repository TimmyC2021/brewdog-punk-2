# Punk IPA's from Punk's API

Technology used in this project:
* React
* API

As part of our course work we were asked to create a React project that would connect to an API at: https://api.punkapi.com/v2/ 

The document to use this is at: https://punkapi.com/ 

The API accepts some parameters to allow filtering of the results. Other filters had to be applied to the data after it had been returned.
